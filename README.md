<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Step 1

Step 3:
After you've created your resource group navigate back the menu and select virtual machines. Create a virtual machine putting it in the resource group you created in the first step. Select same or similar timeframe that the resource group was put in, select your program(Windows 10 pro), and create the username/password you'll be using to access the virtual machine once created.
